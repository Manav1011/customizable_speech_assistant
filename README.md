# customizable_speech_assistant
I have made a speech assistant script in python in which you can add your own custom voice command to execute tasks like opening a program/software on your pc,
open a webpage etc.

it uses a local database called tinydb which will store you command on the local disk

the folder contains requirements.txt file in which i have included all the required pytohn modules to run the script

i have also include a desktop app which can run on any pc(having python or not).
